# Geographic Distribution of Orders Tab

This tab gives a clear geographic view of where orders are shipped, helping optimize logistics, reduce costs, and improve decision-making by:
- Mapping all shipped orders to visualize delivery reach and density by state.
- Showing the states with the highest order volumes to identify priority regions.
- Support cost-saving strategies by identifying optimal routes and selecting carriers that offer the best rates for high-volume states.
- Filtering by Entry Type (e.g., 321, 7501) â€” critical for compliance and aligning with business focus.
- Displaying monthly shipped order quantities to spot seasonal trends.
- By combining geographic insights with volume data, this tab helps leaders make informed decisions that directly impact shipping efficiency and profitability.
